# Version 1.0.0 - Latest release

PR[#22] (https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/16) Implemented Pig shape.
Issue[#21] (https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/issues/21) Solved bug in computing normal to a box and cylinder.
PR[#15] (https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/15) Implemented Cones and Cylinder shapes.
PR[#12] (https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/12) Implemented an algorithm to parallelize the rendering of an image, to reduce computing times. We also added a progress bar to to monitor the progression of the rendering process.
PR[#	10] (https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/10) Implemented the Point-Light tracing, a quick rendering algorithm.
PR[#9] (https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/9) Fixed an issue with Axis-Aligned Box.
PR[#8](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/8) Implemented antialiasing algorithm to have better image. There is now one more parameter in Demo mode, spp (sample extracted per pixel). It must be' a perfect square.
PR [#6](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/6) Implemented a path tracing algorithm to render an image. This includes the following classes: Material, BRDF, Pigment, PCG random number generator
PR [#5](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/5) implements a series of improvements to the project, including:
- Command Line Interface. See [README](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/blob/master/README.md) for usage and examples 
- Implemented `Shape` objects: Sphere, Plane, Axis-Aligned Box and Constructive Solid Geometry
- Fixed an issue with the vertical order of the images [#4](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/4) (solving [#3](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/issues/3))
- Complete documentation, available [here](https://andreasala98.github.io/NM4PIG)
- Implemented `Ray` and `Camera` features [#2](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/2) 

# Version 0.2.0
- Implemented basic Geometry features, such as `Point` and `Vec` [#1](https://github.com/andreasala98/NM4PIG/pull/1)

# Version 0.1.0
- First release of the code.
