Welocome to NM4PIG!
This is a raytracing library written in C#. It was developed for the course _Numerical Methods for Photorealistic Image Generation_ held by Prof. [Maurizio Tomasi][1] at Universit√† degli Studi di Milano (A.Y. 2020-2021).

The contibutors to the project are [Tommaso Armadillo][2], [Pietro Klausner][3] and [Andrea Sala][4].

## Prerequisites

This library has been developed and tested with .NET version 5.0.x. It is possible to download the latest version [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

This library uses some external libraries. The user should not worry as .NET automatically imports them with the repository download. The libraries are listed below:

- [ImageSharp][5] to convert `.pfm` images into LDR formats
- [CommandLineUtils][8] to handle Command Line Interface
- [ShellProgressBar][9] to show a nice progress bar while rendering

## Usage

In order to use the library you can clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:andreasala98/NM4PIG.git

To check that the code works as expected, you can run a set of tests using the following command (from the NM4PIG/Trace.Test directory):

    dotnet test

### Render mode

Our program is developed to be used mainly in _render_ mode. This mode reads an external file with instructions from the scene, and then performs photorealistic ray tracing according to the specified parameters. In order to use the render mode, you can run the following command (from the NM4PIG/NM4PIG folder):

    dotnet run -- render --file Files/dummy.txt -ldr dummy.jpg

This command will read the instructions present in the file ```dummy.txt``` and generate an image called ```dummy.jpg```. Feel free to use your preferred editor to visualize the image generated. If you want to explore all the settable parameters, you can run

    dotnet run -- render --help


### How to create input files

This Section is being written. Please be patient.



### Demo mode

<img align="right" src="/Examples/DemoAnimation/spheres-perspective.gif" width="300"/>

To run the application and visualize a simple image, use the following command (from the NM4PIG/NM4PIG directory):

    dotnet run -- demo

The command uses some default parmaeters. Feel free to explore all the possible options and to use the most suitable for you

    dotnet run -- demo --help

It is also possible to vary the angle of the camera in degrees (-a <ANGLE>) in order to obtain something like the image shown (see `Examples/DemoAnimation/`)

##### Available shapes

The program can be executed in `demo` mode, adding any of the following shapes to the environment:
- Spheres
- Planes
- Axis-Aligned Boxes (AAB)
- Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG): Union, Intersection and Difference of any pair of shapes of the ones mentioned above

Each shape can be transformed upon creation with a composition of scaling, translations and rotation around any of the three axes.

### Convert mode

To convert an existing `.pfm` file into a `.png` or `.jpg` file, type the following command (if no arguments are passed some default values are used):
 
    dotnet run -- convert -f <FACTOR> -g <GAMMA>
    
To clean NM4PIG directory from generated `.png` and `.jpg` samples, type  `./clean.sh` . If you want to keep an image, make sure to add a 'G' before the format (e.g. SampleG.jpg). This will prevent your image from being deleted.
