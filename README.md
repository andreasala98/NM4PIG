## Prerequisites
This library has been developed and tested with .NET version 5.0.x. It is possible to download the latest version [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).

This library uses some external libraries. The user should not worry because .NET automatically import them
- [ImageSharp][5] `dotnet add package SixLabors.ImageSharp`

## Usage

In order to use the library you can clone the repository:

    git clone git@github.com:andreasala98/NM4PIG.git

To check that the code works as expected, you can run a set of tests using the following command:

    cd Trace.Test
    dotnet test

To run the console application:

    cd NM4PIG
    dotnet run <args>
    
To clean NM4PIG directory from generated samples, execute  `clean.sh` . If you want to keep an image, make sure to add a 'G' before the format (e.g. SampleG.jpg). This will prevent your image from being deleted.
