# So here we are on our fourth example.

# We will generate a scene using the Point-light renderer, which is quite fast 
# and works when you want a point-like source of light in your scene.

# Let's try to do an image of the Earth in space.


# Let's begin with the Materials. We need one for space and one for the Earth.

material spaceMat(diffuse(uniform(<0,0,0>)), uniform(<0,0,0>)) 		
# outer space is dark!


material earthMat(diffuse(uniform(<0, 0, 0>)),image("Texture/world.pfm"))  
# as used in other examples, this command use the image "Texture/world.pfm" 
# to generate the Material for our Earth.


# Now let's put a Sphere Shape in the center of the picture. It will be made of earthMat.

sphere(earthMat, translation([4,0,0]))
# even though the universe is not geocentric, let's pretend for a moment it is!

# And now the space, which will be' modeled as a huge sphere.
sphere(spaceMat, scaling([250,250,250]))

# Now it's time to add the Sun. It's very far from the earth, and we'll pretend that it will be' a point-like light source.
# We have to add a 'pointlight' object: we need to specify where (a Vector) it is and the color of the light it emits (and a Color).

pointlight( [4, 200, 200],    # the sun is far far away (not in a galaxy far far away though)
	    <1, 0.878, 0.063> 	  # I found a nice bright yellow for the Sun's light.
)

pointlight( [4, 200, 200], <1, 0.878, 0.063>)
pointlight( [4, 200, 200], <1, 0.878, 0.063>)
pointlight( [4, 200, 200], <1, 0.878, 0.063>)


# and now we conclude with the mandatory camera declaration:

camera(perspective, identity, 1.0, 1.0)

# We've declared everything we needed! We are now ready to execute the program!
# move to the NM4PIG/NM4PIG folder and the launch
# dotnet run -- render --file Examples/Inputs/Scene1/scene1.txt --width 1000 --height 700 --ldr Examples/Inputs/Scene1/scene1.jpg --spp 4

# We wil go deeper into the arguments passed in the following tutorials!
# For now, enjoy the image you've just created :)
